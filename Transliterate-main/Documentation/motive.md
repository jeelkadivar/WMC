Due to Unexpected Outbreak of Covid-19 Every Educational institute was forced to adapt the online Methodology in order to continue the Education.
We identified one of the issue which was concerning to large number of students and was a hurdle in their Education.
We noticed that due to lack of Resources and Guidance many students were not able to access online Educational facilities from their respective Institutions. Thus, they referred to the online available Educational Content but the available content was mainly in the widely spoken languages across globe like English, Spanish, French, etc. 
Thus, Remote learning students were uncomfortable in understanding the contents of the lecture due to dissimilarity in the Languages.
Thus we Team RuntimeTerror(:>) tried to develop a Solution which could help overcome this issue.
With the Help of Transliterate Students can themselves translate the lectures into their Preferred Languages without any external help within few secs.
We developed such a solution which can translate the educational content including lecture's audio, lecture notes and assignments in more than 100 languages spoken all across the Globe.
