# Transliterate

- This is `Flask web-app`. 
- Its `Heroku app` is available as well.

  <summary><b>üßµ A short note from developer!</b></summary>
  <br/>
  There is a high possibility that the Heroku link might not work in future because I might loss the free teir access soon. If it fails to work, you can still use the application by `git cloning` it.
  <br/>

 > From a developer's perspective, I think it would be best to use the Flask app!

  <summary><h2>Transliterate-2</h2> (a newer and better version of this app)</summary>
  <br/>
 A newer version of this app is available <a href="https://github.com/SohamRatnaparkhi/transliterate-v2">here</a> but as this version is very close to my heart, I won't drop this version.
 
 The latest version though - has some added features like:
 
 * Translation of video along with audio with text.
 * Much better UI
 * Now users wont get redirected to a new page to see the translation.
